## About me

I graduated from [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) with bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Chemical Engineering in August, 2022. I've been working as a software engineer since then. I like being
multidisciplinary while digging deep into each field as much as I can. Thus, I've gained experience in fields varying from web and mobile app development to backend and blockchain to cloud computing.
