## About me

I graduated from [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) with bachelor's degree in Computer Science in August, 2022. I've been working as a software engineer since then in various companies. I like being
multidisciplinary while digging deep into each field as much as I can. Thus, gained experience in fields varying from high level web and mobile app development to lower level docker image executable
for tablets on C++ to cloud computing. I'm also passionate about AI applications and blockchain development.
